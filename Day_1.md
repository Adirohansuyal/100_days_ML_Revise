# 100 Days of Machine Learning - Introduction

This video marks the beginning of a series titled "100 Days of Machine Learning." It provides an introduction to the field, explains why it has become so popular recently, and outlines the roadmap for the upcoming course..

## Key Highlights of the Video

### Course Overview

* The instructor plans to upload one video every day for 100 days.
* The focus is on the Machine Learning Life Cycle, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment, rather than just learning algorithms.
* It is designed for beginners to intermediate learners.

### What is Machine Learning?

* It is defined as giving computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
* **Conventional Programming**: You provide a program (logic) and input to get an output.
* **Machine Learning**: You provide input and output data, and the machine learning algorithm generates the logic (the program) by identifying patterns.

### Why to Use Machine Learning?

* **Complexity**: It handles tasks where you cannot write manual "if-else" rules for every scenario, such as Spam Classification or Image Recognition (e.g., identifying different breeds of dogs).
* **Adaptability**: ML models can automaticallly adjust to new data patterns without manual code changes.
* **Data Mining**: It is essential for finding hidden patterns in massive datasets.

### The Boom of Machine Learning

* Although the theory has existed for decades, ML became a "superstar" after 2010 due to two factors:
  1. **Massive Data**: The explosion of internet and smartphone usage provided the necessary data to train models.
  2. **Hardware Advancement**: The availability of powerful GPUs and high RAM allowed complex algorithms to run efficiently.

### Career Outlook

* The instructor notes that there is currently a high demand and low supply of ML talent, leading to high salaries. He encourages learning now while the field is still in its high-growth phase.
